# 🎬 React Movie App

This project was built to understand and implement key concepts of React. The goal was to create a dynamic movie application where users can browse, search, and interact with movie data, while applying various core principles of React development.

## 📚 Knowledge Gained

Throughout this project, the following React concepts were explored and implemented:

### 🔧 Components  
- Created modular and reusable UI building blocks.

### 📦 Props  
- Passed data and functions between components for flexibility and reuse.

### 🧠 useState  
- Managed local component state to reflect user interactions and UI changes.

### ⏱ useEffect  
- Performed side effects like data fetching and localStorage updates.

### 🎯 Event Handling  
- Captured and responded to user actions such as clicks, input changes, and form submissions.

### 🌗 Conditional Rendering  
- Rendered elements dynamically based on state or prop values.

### 🧭 React Router  
- Added routing functionality to navigate between different pages/views.

### 🔗 Link Component  
- Enabled in-app navigation without full page reloads using `<Link>` from React Router.

### 🔁 Array Methods  
- Used methods like:
  - `map()` for rendering lists
  - `filter()` to manage search and filtering
  - `some()` and `includes()` for validation and condition checks

### ✨ Spread Operator (`...`)  
- Efficiently copied and updated state or prop objects/arrays immutably.

### 📡 Component Communication  
- Managed communication between:
  - **Parent to Child** using props
  - **Child to Parent** using callback functions passed down as props
